# RendezView

RendezView is a Python web application built using Dash that allows users to easily select the most appropriate date or dates for an activity, holiday, or any other event. This README provides instructions for setting up the project, installing dependencies, and running the application.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python (>=3.7)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

    Open a terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Dolan-codin/RendezView.git
    ```

    Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd RendezView
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**

    It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Run the following commands to set up and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

    - On Windows:

      ```bash
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

    - On macOS and Linux:

      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

3. **Install the required packages**

    With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Application

1. **Run the main application**

    With the virtual environment still activated, run the following command to start the application:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. **Access the application**

    Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8050/` to access the RendezView application.

## Usage

Once the application is running, users can:

- Select a range of dates using the date picker.
- View and select the most appropriate dates for their activities or events.
